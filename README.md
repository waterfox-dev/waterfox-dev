# Hi there, I'm Clem 

## About Me

I'm an engineering apprentice at UTBM, specializing in Computer Science. I'm currently working at SAP, where I'm developing a performance regression testing tool.

I'm constantly learning and experimenting with different approaches to building software. I believe that good code starts with good architecture, and curiosity drives everything I do.

## What I'm Into

*Software Architecture*  
I spend time thinking about how systems fit together and how to design applications that don't become a nightmare to maintain. I'm into exploring different architectural patterns and learning from both successful and failed approaches.

*Cross-Platform Development*   
Writing code once and having it work across multiple platforms is appealing. I've been diving into various solutions like Flutter, React Native, Kotlin Multiplatform, and .NET MAUI to understand their trade-offs and how they solve similar problems differently.

*Mobile Development*   
I'm currently testing and comparing different mobile frameworks. Flutter's reactive approach, SwiftUI's declarative syntax, native Android development - I like getting hands-on with each to understand their real-world strengths and limitations beyond the marketing material.

*Programming Paradigms*  
I don't believe in "one true way" of programming. Object-oriented, functional, reactive, declarative â€“ they're all tools in the toolbox. What interests me is understanding when and why to use each approach.

## Let's Connect

Always up for talking about architecture decisions, debating framework choices, or discussing code. Feel free to reach out!
